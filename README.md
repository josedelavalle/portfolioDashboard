I work full-time as a Full-Stack .Net Programmer, developing web apps for companies of all sizes.  Here is a collection of some of my side projects I have built throughout the years.
Cycle through them with the slider at top/center

1) World population break-down tool that allows for filtering of gender seperated population data for user selected country of the world.  Up to 5 countries at any one time can be added, with various charts/graphs and detail information generated for comparing and contrasting desired nations.

2) App shows photos, consumed from the Flckr API, taken at desired coordinates throught the world.  Photos default to the location of the browser making the initial request, but can be changed by dragging map marker on Google Map.  Additionally user typed input is geocoded to alternatively find desired latitude and longitude, however if value entered does not correspond with a physical location (eg. 'dog') a keyword and tag search on Flckr's collection of uploaded photographs is performed instead.

3) One stop app for news from around the internet.  Cycle through various internet news sources to see current articles from corresponding each site's homepage.  Feeling curious?  Hit the big read button to navigate to a random news site.  Or search for specific outlets through the provided typeahead.  The layout of the found articles can be customized through top menu for chaning sidebar placement to your desired style.

4) The 50 US States, searchable, and with state flags.  Filter returned states with a fuzzy search.  Drill down to your desired state for iconic image of selected state with a list of counties within.  Further filter counties through input.  Button provided to display a Google Map at center (lat/long) of pertainable county.  Click on county name to open new tab with a redirection to that counties official website.

5) Datepicker allows you to explore NASA's Pic of the Day API.  Also choose from MARS Rover Curiosity and Opportunity to see pictures from the Red Planet captured on that given day.  Satelite imagery is also available for an entered location (or defaulting to browser location).  Finally a Sound Cloud widget has been embedded to hear the sound of a probe entering Juniter's atmosphere.

6) A summary page of who I am, what I do (and done), and an inline form for sending me an email.  Feel free to drop me a line. =)
